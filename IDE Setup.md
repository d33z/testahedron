IDE Setup for LX Studio IDE
==

LX Studio IDE currently uses the temurin-11 SDK (Java 11).


## IntelliJ 
Open the project in IntelliJ using `LXStudio-IDE/` as the root.

You may need to select the Java SDK in the Project Structure:

As well as in the App Run Config:

If can be handy to edit LX Studio's JSON config files in the IDE. Add the .lfp and .lxp extension to be recognized as JSON.

Open preferences (⌘-, on Mac) and go to Editor → File Types → JSON.
